         to be careful about is that in programming , as with math it follows something called BODMAS which defines the order that calculations are completed.
         first thing that happens are anything thats in a bracket and then anything tha's an exponent or a root and then we have our division or multiplication, and finally our addition or subtraction. so you might have written the as weight divided by heigth */

At the moment, and the exclamation mark means to force unwrap optionals, this expressses our certainty that when the segue is identified its goTOResult , then the destination view controller that gets created is definitely going to be a ResultViewController.
